# VeritySpec Sprint Roadmap

VeritySpec matures through small, shippable sprints. Each sprint should leave
the repository in a releasable state with tests, examples, documentation, and CI
checks updated alongside code.

The GitHub issues and milestones are the operational roadmap. This file is the
repository-level summary.

## Completed Foundation

| Sprint | Status | Focus |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Complete | CLI contract, version output, JSON output, stable exit codes |
| 2 | Complete | Semantic validation, reference rules, graph checks, validation reports |
| 3 | Complete | Pack manifests, pack listing, pack validation |
| 4 | Complete | Executable examples and core documentation |
| 5 | Complete | Release automation, package build checks, GitHub release workflow |
| 6 | Complete | Public package polish, badges, install guidance, PyPI preparation |
| 7 | Complete | Contract intelligence: `doctor`, `explain`, graph filters, `--fail-on` |
| 8 | Complete | PrismSpec import bridge and migration reports |

## v0.2.0

The `v0.2.0` milestone is released.

| Sprint | Status | Focus |
|---:|---|---|
| 9 | Complete | Version registry, workspace version validation, `verity migrate`, version-aware diffing |
| 10 | Complete | External pack loading through workspace `packPaths` and CLI `--pack-path` flags |
| 11 | Complete | Generator maturity, richer OpenAPI/AsyncAPI metadata, golden type/model snapshots |
| 12 | Complete | CI productization, release notes, action warning cleanup, v0.2.0 release readiness |

## Sprint 12 Priorities

Sprint 12 should finish the `v0.2.0` line by making VeritySpec easier to adopt
from downstream repositories:

- Add a reusable or copy-paste CI workflow for product-contract checks.
- Add a canonical AI-agent entry point for coding agents.
- Add a post-commit context refresh rule for AI agents.
- Add shell-discipline guidance for `zsh`, `bash`, and PowerShell command use.
- Add v0.2.0 release notes.
- Review GitHub Actions version warnings.
- Run final package build, wheel install, examples, importer, generator, and docs checks.
- Tag and publish the v0.2.0 release when the scope is complete.

## v0.3.0

The `v0.3.0` milestone is released.

| Sprint | Status | Focus |
|---:|---|---|
| 13 | Complete | OpenAPI path-parameter extraction and generator precision |
| 14 | Complete | Python nested-object model generation |
| 15 | Complete | Pack authoring scaffold |
| 16 | Complete | v0.3.0 release preparation |

## Sprint 13 Priorities

Sprint 13 should improve generated contract accuracy:

- Parse path parameters from API endpoint paths such as `/users/{userId}`.
- Emit OpenAPI path parameters with stable names, `required: true`, and schema metadata.
- Avoid duplicate parameters when endpoint records already define explicit parameters.
- Add or update fixtures and golden expectations for generator output.
- Keep README, changelog, roadmap, release notes, version references, and issue or milestone state aligned.
- Add local-verification fallback guidance for GitHub Actions billing, credit, quota, or runner outages.
- Adopt a repository branching strategy and require AI agents to follow it.
- Update generator documentation and roadmap notes.

## Sprint 14 Priorities

Sprint 14 should make generated Python models more useful:

- Generate nested dataclasses for inline object properties.
- Generate nested dataclasses for inline object schemas inside arrays.
- Preserve required and optional field semantics in nested models.
- Update generator maturity fixtures and golden Python model output.
- Keep README, changelog, roadmap, generator docs, and issue state aligned.

## Sprint 15 Priorities

Sprint 15 should make extension pack authoring easier:

- Add a CLI command for creating a local pack scaffold.
- Generate a valid pack manifest and starter schema directory.
- Include validation coverage for the generated scaffold.
- Update README, changelog, roadmap, and pack docs.

## Sprint 16 Priorities

Sprint 16 should release the completed `v0.3.0` scope:

- Promote Unreleased changelog entries into `0.3.0`.
- Bump package metadata to `0.3.0`.
- Add v0.3.0 release notes.
- Update README and install references to `v0.3.0`.
- Run local release verification and GitHub Actions.
- Tag and publish the v0.3.0 GitHub release when checks pass.
- Close the v0.3.0 milestone after release verification.

## v0.4.0

The active milestone is `v0.4.0`.

| Sprint | Status | Focus |
|---:|---|---|
| 17 | Complete | Migration chains and workspace format evolution |

## Sprint 17 Priorities

Sprint 17 should make workspace migration version-aware:

- Add a migration registry that reports supported workspace versions and steps.
- Add path planning for chained migrations instead of a single hard-coded target check.
- Introduce workspace format `v0.2.0` while keeping `v0.1.0` supported.
- Migrate legacy workspaces through `legacy -> v0.1.0 -> v0.2.0` by default.
- Add `verity migrate --list` for migration capability discovery.
- Update examples, docs, tests, README, changelog, roadmap, and AI-agent guidance.

## Later Candidates

These are intentionally not committed to a release until the current milestone
is complete:

- UI, security, observability, accessibility, deployment, and compliance packs.
- Downstream project templates and examples.

## Working Rule

No sprint is complete unless:

- Tests pass.
- CI passes.
- Documentation and examples match the implemented behavior.
- New behavior has at least one executable test or CLI smoke check.
